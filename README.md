## For detailed audio-visual explaination of this project - refer this video -> https://youtu.be/49G2uIdIseg

This project is made as part of selection task for research internship at IIT Gandhinagar for the project of developing SpiroMask end-to-end.

### What this project tells about? 
-> This project is about identifying breathing information from audio recorded by microphone place inside an clothg mask. This can be achieved by analyzing various audio signals lying at particular frequency ranges (like 50 Hz. to 150 Hz.). Here, I have did a basic analysis of audio signals. More detailed analysis with the help of ML and relevant apparatus will help us to derive more useful information which can be used for diagnosis of any Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

### What this repository contains?
 This repository contains Jupyter Notebook file, images of graphs obtained using Audacity and the audio file which was generated using voice recorder for breathing test.
